Original Code By: Michael Sheppard. Adapted to the Rnssp Package by: Gbedegnon Roseric Azondekon. National Syndromic Surveillance Program. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). create_dir: true  Detailed Description The state emergency department report template (state_ed_report) summarizes trend classification and ESSENCE alerting for the CCDD categories at the state and county level. Users can select percentages, counts, or percentages and counts for state and county-level time series. By default, trends are reported as a percent of daily emergency department visits.\nTo classify trends over time, this template applies penalized least squares smoothing splines to time series of percentages and Poisson generalized additive models to time series of counts. The slopes of the smoothed data are used to classify daily trajectory statuses into categories of increase, stable, or decrease. Slopes greater than a pre-defined slope cut point of 0.01 are classified as increasing, while slopes less than -0.01 are classified as decreasing. Slopes with an absolute value less than or equal to 0.01 are classified as stable. This method is best suited for classification of county-level time series with higher variability in day-to-day trends.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re pulling current data, use a 3-day lag. This best practice prevents lower counts associated with lags in receiving data from biasing the most recent classification.\nTo identify stratifications with recent and anomalous increases in syndromic activity, ESSENCE alerting is overlaid on the time series for each county and CCDD category. These alerts correspond to ESSENCE's default alerting algorithm, Poisson/EWMA/Regression Switch, with alerting thresholds 0.05 (yellow) and 0.01 (red).\nDaily stratified alerting indicators and statistics are pulled along with the percentages, numerators, and denominators from the time series data table application programming interface (API).\n User Inputs  Access and Magagement Center (AMC) username and password (securely encrypted) State (data are pulled by hospital state from the Facility Location [Full Details] data source CCDD Categories — currently includes all CCDD categories available in ESSENCE.

These data can be pulled into RStudio in JSON format and will match the CC and DD Categories table found under the “More” tab in NSSP-ESSENCE. This example can be run either in the BioSense Platform instance of RStudio Workbench or in a local desktop instance of RStudio. Users must have the Rnssp package installed and will need to save their Access and Management Center (AMC) credentials to a myProfile object to proceed.\nThe following packages are needed to run this example:\nlibrary(tidyverse) library(Rnssp) If you haven’t already saved your AMC credentials to a myProfile object, then run the following code chunk to supply your username and password:\n myProfile \u0026lt;- create_profile()  Out of convenience, you can save your myProfile object to either an .rda or .rds file in your home directory as follows:\n # .rda option save(myProfile, file = \u0026quot;~/myProfile.rda\u0026quot;) # .rds option saveRDS(myProfile, \u0026quot;~/myProfile.rds\u0026quot;)  By saving your myProfile object to your home directory, only you will be able to access and load this file into your global environment. You should only need to update your credentials every 90 days after your AMC password expires. To load your credentials into your environment, you can either use the load() function for an rda file or the readRDS() function for an rds file.\n # .rda option load(\u0026quot;~/myProfile.rda\u0026quot;) # .rds option myProfile \u0026lt;- readRDS(\u0026quot;~/myProfile.rds\u0026quot;)  The API URL to pull the existing list of CCDD categories and their underlying queries will pull from SyndromeDefinitionsServlet_CCDD using the action getCCDDTerms.

Original Code By: Michael Sheppard. Adapted to the Rnssp Package by: Gbedegnon Roseric Azondekon. National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). create_dir: true  Detailed Description The Word Alerts Report template (word_alerts) summarizes daily chief complaints and discharge diagnosis term alerts for a selected syndrome definition.\nThe purpose of the word alert algorithm is to seek anomalous chief complaint free-text terms and discharge diagnosis codes relative to a 28-day sliding baseline.\nThe current implementation of word alerts in NSSP-ESSENCE is limited to data from the past 7 days. This template lets users run the word alert algorithm on any selected date range spanning up to 90 days.\n Description of Word Alert Algorithm The ESSENCE word alert algorithm uses 28-day baselines over which unigram and bigram frequencies are computed. As with the univariate temporal anomaly detection algorithms, a 2-day guardband is used to separate the baseline and test date. For each term that occurred in the testing block (test date), contingency tables are formed to count the number of emergency department encounters with the term/code occurring in the chief complaint/discharge diagnosis and the number of emergency department encounters without the term/code in the chief complaint/discharge diagnosis for both the testing and baseline blocks.\nTwo-by-two contingency table for RASH SKIN    Block Visits with Term Visits without Term     Test Date (Last 24 Hours) A: 136 B: 5,111   Baseline (28 Days) C: 2,851 D: 149,477    To test for anomalous increases in term occurrence on the test date relative to the baseline, either Fisher’s Exact Test or a Chi-squared Test is applied. Fisher’s Exact Test is applied for moderate counts, whereas a Chi-squared Test is applied for large counts. Terms are determined to have moderate counts if the number of visits in the baseline with the term is less than 1,000 or if the number of visits on the test date without the term is less than 1,000, i.e., min(B,C) \u0026lt; 1,000. Unigrams and bigrams are considered anomalous if the resulting p-value is less than 0.001.\n Pre-processing of Chief Complaints and Discharge Diagnoses Pre-processing of chief complaint free text includes removal of punctuation, discharge diagnosis codes, uninformative patterns, medical processing terms, and common first names. Duplicate terms in the same chief complaint and discharge diagnosis are also removed. For discharge diagnosis bigrams, pairings of codes are arranged in alphanumeric order so that permutations of the same codes are not counted separately.\n Report Interactivity This HTML report includes interactive visualizations and tables that accommodate hovering to display additional information. ICD-9 and ICD-10 code descriptions can be displayed by hovering over discharge diagnosis codes. Note that descriptions for SNOMED codes are not available.\n User Inputs  Access and Management Center (AMC) username and password (securely encrypted) Query start and end dates Has Been Emergency: Option to limit data where HasBeenE = Yes Data source: CCQV Datamart Backup (NSSP User Only!) or Facility Location (Full Details) Limit to Site (Full Details only): Limit to Site or All Sites Age Groups: Options include all existing ESSENCE age grouping systems.

Adapted to the Rnssp Package by: Gbedegnon Roseric Azondekon. National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  create_dir: true  Detailed Description The state data quality template calculates and summarizes syndromic surveillance data quality metrics pulled from the BioSense platform and the ESSENCE application programming interface (API) similar to the NSSP Data Quality Dashboards. The template assesses coverage, timeliness, completeness, and validity of patient encounters limited to the selected calculated patient class (C_Patient_Class) that occurred during the chosen date range. The default start and end dates include the previous two weeks of data, with the recommended two day lag time reflected. Note that selecting a date range longer than 90 days will result in extensive rendering time.\nCoverage visualizations include interactive plots of the total active facility count, total patient encounters limited to the selected C_Patient_Class, total HL7 messages received by BioSense for patient encounters limited to the selected C_Patient_Class, and a table of currently onboarding facilities.\nTimeliness visualizations include an overall timeliness plot (depicting first message timeliness), an interactive plot of message counts by NSSP Timeliness Category by facility, an interactive plot of message percentages by NSSP timeliness count by facility, a table containing mean and median first message timeliness by facility, a table containing mean and median chief complaint timeliness by facility (chief complaint lag/delay), and a table containing mean and median diagnosis code timeliness by facility (diagnosis code lag/delay). BioSense platform arrival date time stamps have been adjusted to reflect the user’s selected time zone to avoid adversely affecting timeliness calculations.\nThe template assesses all NSSP Priority 1 and NSSP Priority 2 data elements for completeness and validity. Completeness is assessed by data element across the entire patient encounter (required data fields must be present at least once per C_Biosense_ID), while validity is assessed by data element on a per message or per patient encounter basis, depending on each data field’s requirement level (see the validity definition table in the template for more information).\nCompleteness visualizations include overall completeness plots for each NSSP priority level broken down by data element, time series plots of CCAvailable and DDAvailable pulled using the ESSENCE API, and a table containing chief complaint and diagnosis code completeness by facility. Validity visualizations include overall validity plots for both NSSP priority levels broken down by data element, validity tables for both NSSP priority level data elements by facility, time series plots of CCInformative and DDInformative pulled using the ESSENCE API, an interactive plot containing messages sent to the user\u0026rsquo;s site exceptions table, and a table containing error message counts by facility received during the selected date range.\nInteractive plots were created using the plotly package.

Adapted to the Rnssp Package by: Michael Sheppard. National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  create_dir: true  Detailed Description This template supports asyndromic surveillance by considering all ICD-10 discharge diagnosis codes occurring in a site\u0026rsquo;s emergency department records over a recent time window and identifying codes with statistically significant increases or decreases in trend over an 11-week period. The data pulled does not limit to a specific CCDD Category, syndrome, or query and includes all records occurring in the date range specified by the user. The report includes a summary of discharge diagnosis code types received (i.e., ICD-10, ICD-9, or SNOMED), summary statistics reporting on total unique codes, mean and median character length, and weekly trends of unique code types. The main section of this report includes HTML sparkline tables displaying weekly trends for codes identified as having significant increases/decreases, ESSENCE time series URL links, and associated demographic features. Features include overall code frequencies, mean and median age, and patient sex breakdowns. Please note that the sparklines represent discharge diagnosis unigram trends that are calculated by dividing the weekly number of occurrences of a code by the total summed frequency of all codes occurring in that week. The trends will therefore mirror trends in the ESSENCE time series figure (after clicking on the URL), however the numeric values will not match as the ESSENCE time series displays the percentage of ED visits in which the code occurred. Lastly, this template includes a summary of ICD-10 discharge diagnosis codes that were identified as having significant increases or decreases due to ICD-10 code revisions imposed by CMS in October of each year. Users can define an end date that is constrained to occur on a Saturday (end of an MMWR week) to include a full week\u0026rsquo;s worth of data for the ending week. The start date will automatically be populated as 17 weeks earlier than the end week to include 18 total weeks of data. Keep in mind that trend significance is only assessed for the last 11 weeks of this 18-week period. Lastly, users will choose their site and indicate whether or not they want to limit to records where Has Been E is Yes.\n User Inputs  NSSP Username: AMC and ESSENCE account username NSSP Password: AMC and ESSENCE account password End Date: Saturday end date of the last week to include Has been Emergency: Checked by default to limit to ED encounters.
